## Yellow Jacket Space Program (YJSP) - Flight Feed System

I lead the Flight Feed System Team on YJSP. The Flight Feed System (FFS) delivers liquid propellants to our engine at specified pressures. FFS is a pressure regulated feed system using high pressure gaseous nitrogen (GN2 at 4500 PSI) to feed liquid kerosene (Jet-A) and liquid oxygen (LOX) into our regeneratively cooled engine (YJ-1R).
