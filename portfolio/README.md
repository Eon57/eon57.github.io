# Yellow Jacket Space Program
### Flight Feed System Lead
As the Flight Feed System Lead for Georgia Tech's Yellow Jacket Space Program (YJSP), I lead a team of students working indepentently of faculty. We are resposible for designing, building, and testing the propulsion sustems within Georgia Tech's first liquid-fueled rocket. The Flight Feed System (FFS) delivers liquid propellants to our engine at specified pressures. FFS is a pressure regulated feed system using high pressure gaseous nitrogen (GN2 at 4500 PSI) to feed liquid kerosene (Jet-A) and liquid oxygen (LOX) into our regeneratively cooled engine (YJ-1R).
