## Yellow Jackets Space Program (YJSP)

As the Flight Feed System Lead, I contribute to the design, construction, and testing of the internal portion of our flight vehicle. The rocket is refered to as Subscale since it is the 1:2 scale prototype for the fullscale vehicle we're designing to cross the Kármán line (100 km).
