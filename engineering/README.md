## Yellow Jackets Space Program (YJSP)

As the Flight Feed System Lead, I contribute to the design, assembly, and testing of the flight vehicle's feed system. The rocket is a 18-foot Subscale prototype of our fullscale vehicle which we're designing with the goal of being the first student-built liquid fueled rocket to cross the Kármán line (100 km).

The Flight Feed System (FFS) is a pressure regulated feed system that uses high pressure gaseous nitrogen (GN2) to pressurize Kerosene (Jet-A) and Liquid Oxygen (LOX) tanks. The primary purpose of FFS is to deliver our propellants at particular mass flows into the injector, which then injects the propellant into the engine for optimal combustion.
