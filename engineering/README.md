As the Flight Feed System Lead, I contribute to the design, construction, and testing of the internal portion of our flight vehicle. The rocket is a 14-foot Subscale prototype of the fullscale vehicle we're designing with the goal of being the first student-directed project to cross the K치rm치n line (100 km) using a liquid fueled rocket.

We're aiming to be the first collegiate team to pass the K치rm치n line (100 km) with a liquid fueled rocket. We are currently developing our Subscale vehicle, a test bed for our full scale vehicle. Through designing, building, and testing Subscale we are learning the ins and outs of liquid-fueled rockets, and this is Georgia Tech's first.
