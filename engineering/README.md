As the Flight Feed System Lead, I contribute to the design, construction, and testing of the internal portion of our flight vehicle. The rocket is a 14-foot Subscale prototype of the fullscale vehicle we're designing with the goal of being the first student-directed project to cross the Kármán line (100 km) using a liquid fuel rocket.
