As the Flight Feed System Lead, I contribute to the design, assembly, and testing of the flight vehicle's feed system. The rocket is a 15-foot Subscale prototype of our fullscale vehicle that we're designing with the goal of being the first student-built liquid fueled rocket to cross the Kármán line (100 km).

The Flight Feed System (FFS) is a pressure regulated feed system that uses high pressure gaseous nitrogen (GN2) to pressurize Kerosene (Jet-A) and Liquid Oxygen (LOX) tanks. The primary purpose of FFS is to deliver our propellants at particular mass flows into the injector, which then injects the propellant into the engine for optimal combustion. 

FFS is divided up into four sections, Pressurant, Pneumatics, Fuel, and LOX. The Pressurant section includes the composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) which holds GN2 at 4500 PSI. It also includes two primary dome loaded regulators which feed into the tanks and they are set by a series of hand loaded regulators. The Pneumatics section is down regulated from the pressurant section and it feeds into several solenoids which are used to actuate our pneumatically piloted valves. The Fuel and LOX sections hold the propellants, and the LOX section is rated for cryogenic temperatures.
